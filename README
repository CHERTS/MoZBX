This project is intended as an extra application, built on top of your current Zabbix set-up.

It connects to your Zabbix API URL, using your credentials. Afterwards, all settings are pulled from your Zabbix.

This means any change you make in your Zabbix, will be transported to the Mobile ZBX application.
